# Orion
Minimalist Game about breaking orbs.

Click and drag downward on the lower half of the screen to form a spinning Square, then release to send the Square flying in the opposite direciton. Players must launch the Square at the orbs constantly forming above them to raise their score and keep the timer from running out. Some Orbs will have Power-Ups inside them, allowing the Player's Square to speed up, bounce off walls more, or penetrate through more orbs. Difficulty increases as time goes on.

Orion is programmed in C++ using SFML as a game framwork. I programmed an animation controller to determine the state of the Player Square and Orbs (Forming, Launching, Dying, etc). I also programmed a particle system for special effects, such as when the Player Square flies through the air or when it hits a wall.
